      <h2>Redesigning the Drexel Term Master Schedule Website</h2>
      <p>In the realm of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), intuitive design and user-centric principles are crucial to ensuring digital systems enhance usability and efficiency. The Drexel Term Master Schedule, a website used by students to browse and select courses, presents a variety of design challenges that impact the user experience. By focusing on core HCI principles—visibility, signifiers, mapping, and slips—this case study critiques the current design and proposes enhancements to create a more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly interface.</p>

      <div class="image-container">
        <img 
          src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/original%20TMS%20website.png?raw=true" 
          alt="original-TMS-site" 
          class="responsive-image">
      </div>

      <p>The Drexel Term Master Schedule website is divided into three primary sections: a welcome description, browse courses, and search courses. However, the current layout lacks a clear visual hierarchy, forcing users to scan unnecessarily for the information they need. Input prompts, such as dropdown menus and search bars, are presented without adequate instructions, leading to confusion for first-time users. College students, as the primary users, require quick and simple navigation due to time constraints and limited experience managing complex systems independently.</p>

          alt="before-altered"

          alt="altered-wireframe" 
          class="responsive-image">
      </div>

      <div class="image-container">

      <p>Visibility and signifiers are foundational to effective HCI design. Visibility ensures that key interface elements are readily accessible, while signifiers provide clear cues to guide user interaction. To improve visibility on the Drexel Term Master Schedule, the browse and search course sections should be repositioned above the fold, making them immediately accessible. The welcome description, while informative, can be placed below the fold for secondary reference. Additionally, concise and informative signifiers—such as tooltips or labels explaining input fields—will guide students through the website more efficiently, reducing cognitive load.</p>

      <div class="image-container">
        <img 
          src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/TMS%20browse%20courses.png?raw=true" 
          alt="browse" 
          class="responsive-image">
      </div>

      <p>Mapping bridges the gap between user intent and system functionality. In its current state, the Drexel Term Master Schedule suffers from poor mapping, exemplified by ambiguous yellow arrows that appear clickable but serve no functional purpose. This visual inconsistency causes frustration and disrupts the user experience. To address this issue, the arrows should be redesigned to function as actionable elements, such as expanding dropdowns or providing contextual explanations. Improved mapping will create a predictable and intuitive interaction flow, aligning the user’s mental model with the interface design.</p>

      <div class="image-container">
        <img 
          src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/TMS%20description%20section.png?raw=true" 
          alt="description" 
          class="responsive-image">
      </div>

      <p>Slips occur when users make unintended errors despite knowing their goals. The Drexel Term Master Schedule frequently leads to slips due to cramped layouts, small text, and poorly spaced dropdown options. For example, users often misclick on incorrect terms or quarters when planning their schedules. To mitigate these errors, the layout can be redesigned with larger, bolded text and better spacing between dropdown options. Sectioning options by year and term will further clarify choices, ensuring users complete tasks with confidence and accuracy. These adjustments will reduce frustration and improve overall usability.</p>

      <div class="image-container">
        <img 
          src="https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/compressed%20images/CS2%20Compressed/TMS%20search%20courses.png?raw=true" 
          alt="search" 
          class="responsive-image">
      </div>

      <p>The proposed redesign prioritizes simplicity, visibility, and usability. The primary focus will be on elevating the browse and search functionalities while repositioning less critical elements like the welcome description. Clear signifiers will be added to guide users through each input field, ensuring first-time users understand the required actions. Mapping improvements, such as functional arrows and intuitive dropdown layouts, will streamline navigation. Additionally, adjustments to the layout—including larger text, sectioned inputs, and improved spacing—will prevent slips and reduce user frustration. Together, these changes aim to create an intuitive, student-friendly experience.</p>

      <p>The re-design of the Drexel Term Master Schedule demonstrates the value of applying HCI principles such as visibility, signifiers, mapping, and error prevention. By enhancing visibility, users can quickly locate critical functions like course browsing and searching. Improved mapping ensures a predictable interaction flow, while detailed signifiers guide users through complex tasks. Addressing slips through thoughtful layout design reduces errors and builds user confidence. These design improvements collectively transform the Drexel Term Master Schedule into a user-friendly interface that meets the needs of its primary audience: busy college students seeking efficiency and clarity.</p>
