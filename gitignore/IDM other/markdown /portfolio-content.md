![picture of cats](https://github.com/rem357/idm221-rem357/blob/main/about%20me/m+v.jpeg?raw=true)


Growing up in a loving but chaotic and ever-changing household helped me to learn and develop various skills that taught me I love to use my creativity to simplify, organize, and control chaos in visually appealing ways. These qualities led me to find the wonderful field of UXID. When I’m not in class, studying, working, or exploring Philly, I love going to concerts, listening to music, baking, cooking, watching movies, and going on runs.

I love winter and colder weather; I am an avid skier and have been skiing since I was six, and I enjoy making trips up to the Poconos and Quebec in the winters. I also love photography, video editing, and music, often finding myself holed up for hours creating playlists or experimental edits that incorporate multiple forms of media. I love the outdoors, traveling, and hiking, always searching for cool places to seek out and explore.

We conducted surveys, interviews, and market analysis to identify common issues faced by consumers. Through this process, we discovered that many users found traditional water filtration systems cumbersome to fill and transport, often resulting in spills and inconvenience. Additionally, there was a growing interest in understanding the quality of purified water, specifically knowing what toxins were removed.


Armed with insights from our research, we established the primary objectives for our product:
- **Ease of filling and transportation**
- **Integration of a user-friendly app to provide real-time information on purified water quality**
- **An intuitive design to ensure seamless interaction for users of all demographics**

As a group, we engaged in brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and concepts that addressed the identified needs. Through collaboration and discussion, we narrowed down our options and began prototyping various designs. This iterative process involved rapid prototyping, feedback gathering, and refinement.

One significant challenge we faced was finding the balance between functionality and aesthetics. We wanted our water filtration system to be visually appealing while prioritizing usability. This required frequent iterations and user testing to ensure that our design decisions aligned with the user’s preferences and expectations.

Our iterative design process was fueled by continuous feedback loops. We conducted usability tests with prototypes at various stages of development, soliciting feedback from potential users. This feedback guided our design decisions, allowing us to refine and improve the product iteratively. For example, during one usability test, we discovered that our initial design for the filling mechanism was overly complex, leading to confusion among users. In response, we simplified the design, opting for a one-step filling process that significantly enhanced the user experience.
