    <h2>Designing the Reward Vest</h2>

      <p>
        In my product design class, I was tasked with designing a practical product that would help enhance the everyday life of a superhero.
        I was assigned the Punisher, and after doing a plethora of research on his character, I created The Reward Vest. The Reward Vest was designed with one objective in mind: 
        to enhance the combat effectiveness and survival capabilities of the Marvel character, the Punisher. Known for his brutal and relentless approach to justice, the Punisher operates outside 
        the law, exposing himself to life-threatening situations. This vest concept aims to address his mortality and vulnerabilities, using innovative technology and carefully selected materials 
        to support his unique crime-fighting style.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Reward Vest was designed to sustain the Punisher's life in critical moments, mitigate his weaknesses, and amplify his strengths. This wearable technology leverages advanced materials, 
        AI, and nanotechnology, all while aligning with his gritty, tactical aesthetic. The product is designed to be discreet, lightweight, and easy to deploy in high-stakes scenarios.

      <h2>Components:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Military Dog Tag:</strong> Embedded with a tracking feature, a practical addition reflecting his military background.</li>
        <li><strong>Skull Pendant Locket:</strong> A locket with a picture of his family, adding sentimental value. This pendant can activate the vest when pressed for five seconds.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Medical Injection System: Provides essential medication and neurotransmitters directly into his spine. This system helps Castle recover quickly and maintain focus and energy during intense battles.
      </p>

      <p>
        An interface positioned behind the ear for discreet communication with the AI system provides situational analysis, medical monitoring, and tactical advice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The necklace serves as the central hub, housing nanotechnology that can assemble the vest on command. When triggered by voice or thought command, the nanotechnology deploys across his torso, 
        providing healing, cleaning, and enhanced protection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Reward Vest supports the Punisherâ€™s mission by reinforcing his strengths and compensating for his lack of superhuman abilities. It provides medical, tactical, and survival support in a simple, 
        intuitive design that extends his endurance and capability, allowing him to continue fighting without fear of physical limitation.
